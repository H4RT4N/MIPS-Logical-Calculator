# MIPS-Logical-Calculator
CS 47 Project

Purpose of this project was to build a binary calculator using logic gates and full adders.
This build will reflect the behavior of computer hardware doing addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication.

MIPS was selected for its ability to simulate registers and low level language.
